            <h1>Collaborative Discussion 1</h1>
            <p>This discussion will last for 3 weeks covering units 1, 2, and 3. Ensure you include appropriate citations and references in all your posts (this is not included in the word count for each week's post/submission).</p>

            <h2>Discussion Topic</h2>
            <p>Based on your reading of the case study (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019), answer the following questions in the discussion forum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What do the authors mean by the term ‘Industry 4.0’? Give two examples.</li>
                <li>Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors' categories.</li>
                <li>Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and is a component of the e-portfolio, which you will submit at the end of the module.</p>
