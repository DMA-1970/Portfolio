            <h2>Reflective Thinking</h2>
            <p><strong>Module 1</strong><br>
            Reflection on the first module.</p>
            
            <p>This module has been both a challenging and rewarding experience, particularly as I was able to connect much of the content with my prior knowledge in areas like software licensing and cloud computing. My familiarity with these topics allowed me to engage more deeply with the discussions, especially when comparing the complexities of commercial versus open-source licensing. Additionally, the exploration of cloud computing resonated with my previous experiences, but the module helped me appreciate the broader implications of cloud solutions on business infrastructure and strategic decision-making.</p>

            <p>One of the most significant personal milestones was overcoming my apprehension towards programming. Initially, I was hesitant about the practical exercises, but as I delved into the programming tasks, I began to understand the logic and structure behind coding. This newfound confidence was a key achievement, as it not only demystified programming for me but also equipped me with valuable skills that are increasingly important in the IT landscape. I now write programs for simple tasks in my daily job.</p>

            <p>During my studies, I was given the opportunity to assume the role of Enterprise Technology Manager at MillTechFX. While this position offered significant professional growth, I was aware that balancing the demands of a new role alongside the rigorous requirements of a research degree could present considerable challenges. Despite my initial concerns about the potential for one commitment to detract from the other, I have successfully navigated this dual responsibility, ensuring that my academic and professional obligations were met with diligence and effectiveness.</p>
            
            <p>Moreover, I found the deep dive into digital transformation particularly enlightening. While I had a general understanding of digitalization, the module's focus on BPMN, UML, and the structured representation of digital processes provided me with a clearer, more practical perspective. This deeper exploration allowed me to appreciate the complexity and importance of digital transformation in modern enterprises, further solidifying my interest in this critical area of IT.</p>

            <p>Overall, the module not only reinforced my existing knowledge but also pushed me to expand my skills and understanding in areas where I previously lacked confidence.</p>
