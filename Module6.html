          <strong>Summary:</strong>
          Week 1 introduced the evolution of cloud computing, from early virtualisation technologies to modern multi-cloud ecosystems. It covered the three core service models — IaaS, PaaS, SaaS — and examined deployment models such as public, private, hybrid, and community cloud. Comparisons between AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure highlighted service portfolios, scalability options, and pricing structures.<br><br>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong>
          As an Enterprise Technology Manager, I had a working knowledge of these foundational concepts, but revisiting them in a comparative context helped me identify subtle provider distinctions that influence strategic decision-making. In my current role, we use AWS S3 buckets for data storage and analytics workloads, while Azure Active Directory underpins enterprise identity management. My cross-platform expertise, supported by certifications such as Microsoft 365 Fundamentals and Microsoft Information Protection and Compliance Administrator Associate, enables me to navigate both ecosystems effectively and ensure security, governance, and compliance alignment. A critical takeaway this week was recognising that while multi-cloud adoption offers resilience and vendor flexibility, it can also create governance challenges and increase the demand for skilled personnel capable of managing multiple platforms.<br><br>
          <strong>Application:</strong>
          This understanding directly informs workload placement and procurement decisions, allowing me to balance performance, compliance, and cost efficiency when advising on enterprise cloud strategy.<br><br>
          <strong>Forward Planning:</strong>
          I intend to explore further vendor management tools such as AWS Organizations and Azure Lighthouse to strengthen cross-platform governance and streamline policy enforcement across multi-cloud environments.

          <strong>Summary:</strong>
          This week focused on frameworks that guide cloud architecture. TOGAF offered a structured method for aligning IT with business strategy, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) reinforced disciplined processes in cloud solution delivery, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) highlighted how automation improves consistency, scalability, and compliance. Collectively, these approaches help ensure cloud deployments are strategic, controlled, and repeatable.<br><br>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong>
          TOGAF is particularly relevant because it encourages a business-first approach to cloud architecture. In practice, I have often seen technical teams prioritise tool implementation without aligning outcomes to business needs. TOGAF's phased Architecture Development Method provides a reminder that strategy and governance should guide deployment choices. SDLC similarly resonated, as cloud environments still require traditional structure for planning, testing, and stakeholder engagement. IaC struck a strong chord with me; having experienced the operational inefficiencies of manual deployments, I see how IaC reduces configuration drift and enforces auditability, which is vital in regulated industries.<br><br>
          <strong>Application:</strong>
          Applying TOGAF in my environment could help ensure our AWS and Azure architectures remain strategically aligned and compliant. Embedding SDLC principles into cloud change management would improve testing and rollback, reducing production risk. IaC is already present in Azure deployments for compliance monitoring, but scaling it across both AWS and Azure would improve efficiency while strengthening adherence to frameworks such as GDPR and FCA guidelines.<br><br>
          <strong>Forward Planning:</strong>
          I intend to explore how TOGAF ADM can be tailored to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, and how policy-as-code can complement IaC to improve governance. Embedding SDLC checkpoints into IaC pipelines will also be a priority, ensuring automation remains aligned with compliance and testing requirements.

          <strong>Summary:</strong>
          This week, we examined hybrid cloud strategies, which integrate on-premises infrastructure with public or private cloud services. We explored patterns such as cloud bursting for peak demand, maintaining data sovereignty for compliance, and segmenting workloads according to security and performance requirements.<br><br>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong>
          While I have managed both cloud and on-premises environments in the past, studying structured hybrid models provided a deeper understanding of integration strategies. In my current role, we operate a multi-cloud architecture divided by function: AWS S3 buckets store and manage our data workloads, while Azure Active Directory supports enterprise identity management. Microsoft Purview is used to enforce compliance, and Microsoft Defender safeguards enterprise assets. This arrangement reinforces the need for consistent governance, interoperability, and cross-platform policy alignment — areas where my cross-platform skills and Microsoft certifications have been invaluable. One critical insight is that although multi-cloud enhances resilience and vendor flexibility, it also increases administrative overhead and the need for standardised processes across platforms.<br><br>
          <strong>Application:</strong>
          In the financial services sector, hybrid and multi-cloud approaches enable sensitive workloads to remain in controlled environments while using cloud elasticity for analytics and high-volume processing. Our AWS–Azure split not only optimises performance but also mitigates single-vendor dependency and maintains compliance with frameworks such as GDPR and PCI DSS.<br><br>
          <strong>Forward Planning:</strong>
          I intend to explore AWS Outposts and Azure Arc to extend hybrid capabilities, enabling unified policy management and more seamless compliance enforcement across both platforms.

          <strong>Summary:</strong>
          This week focused on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its importance in cloud environments. TOGAF was introduced as a governance framework for structuring architecture, while IaC enables automation, repeatability, and auditability in deployments. The key activity involved creating and executing a Bash script on OpenStack to automate server setup, reinforcing how automation reduces manual effort and supports scalability. These principles connect closely to Wiggins' (2017) Twelve-Factor App model, which emphasises consistency and automation in cloud-native design.<br><br>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong>
          The scripting exercise was practical and insightful. While I am more experienced with PowerShell and Azure automation, Bash on OpenStack demonstrated the universality of scripting across platforms. IaC emerged as vital for addressing configuration drift, a recurring challenge in multi-cloud operations. The seminar highlighted benefits such as scalability and resilience (Mungoli, 2023), but also the risks of unchecked automation, where errors can propagate rapidly. TOGAF's phased approach provided a reminder that automation must sit within a strategic governance framework.<br><br>
          <strong>Application:</strong>
          In my role, IaC can strengthen compliance by embedding security policies, audit logging, and monitoring directly into code. This is particularly important in financial services, where FCA and GDPR obligations demand consistency. The scripting exercise demonstrated how automation reduces operational overhead while improving standardisation. Oliveira and Hugo (2021) also reminded me that combining IaC with event-driven microservices architectures could further optimise responsiveness and efficiency in cloud deployments.<br><br>
          <strong>Forward Planning:</strong>
          I plan to explore policy-as-code tools to embed compliance rules into IaC workflows and extend my scripting skills across OpenStack and multi-cloud platforms. I also aim to connect TOGAF principles with IaC and microservices, ensuring automation is not only efficient but also strategically aligned with enterprise goals.<br><br>

        <p class="reflection"><strong>Summary:</strong> This week explored cloud-native technologies, focusing on the Twelve-Factor App methodology (Wiggins, 2017) and Kubernetes as a container orchestration tool. The content emphasised how cloud-native design principles ensure scalability, resilience, and agility in application development. The lecturecast on AI-driven cloud computing further demonstrated how automation and intelligent orchestration are transforming deployment and management of containerised workloads.</p>
        <p class="reflection"><strong>Reflection:</strong> The 12-Factor methodology resonated with me as it provides a practical checklist for building applications that are portable and cloud-ready. In practice, I have observed how ignoring principles such as strict separation of config from code can create fragility when scaling services. Kubernetes was equally significant, as it operationalises these principles through automated scaling, load balancing, and self-healing. Academic insights reinforce these ideas: Hamzaoui et al. (2024) highlight that containers deliver lightweight, portable environments that outperform traditional hypervisors, while Bonomi et al. (2012) and Gupta et al. (2016) illustrate how fog and edge computing extend cloud-native benefits closer to users, reducing latency for IoT and real-time applications. The integration of AI into orchestration workflows also sparked reflection on how predictive scaling and policy enforcement could further reduce operational overheads.</p>
        <p class="reflection"><strong>Application:</strong> In financial services, these principles directly apply to scaling transaction-processing systems and analytics platforms. For example, containerising microservices that handle compliance checks could improve resilience while Kubernetes ensures they are dynamically scaled based on demand. AI-driven orchestration adds further value by anticipating workload spikes, which is critical for trading platforms where milliseconds matter.</p>
        <p class="reflection"><strong>Forward Planning:</strong> I plan to experiment with Kubernetes deployments that integrate policy-as-code to enforce compliance while leveraging AI models for predictive scaling. Additionally, I aim to apply 12-Factor principles when reviewing internal applications, ensuring portability and resilience remain embedded in future cloud-native solutions.</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Summary:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">This week focused on AI-driven cloud computing and cloud design tools. The lecturecast explored how AI enhances automation, security, and cost optimisation across cloud environments. We examined practical applications such as dynamic resource allocation, predictive fault detection, and compliance monitoring. The seminar also compared scripting approaches (Bash, Python, Terraform) with GUI-based tools (Azure Portal, AWS Console), weighing flexibility against accessibility. Finally, we discussed how AI-driven automation is reshaping administrator roles, shifting emphasis towards governance, strategy, and architecture (Bonomi et al., 2012; Hamzaoui et al., 2024).</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Reflection:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">I found AI’s role in proactive fault detection particularly valuable, as predictive analytics can prevent downtime in financial services where resilience is critical (Gupta et al., 2016). Similarly, AI-driven security tools such as Microsoft Sentinel strengthen incident response and support compliance with ISO 27001. Reflecting on scripting versus GUI tools, I realised that while GUIs remain useful for troubleshooting, scripting and Infrastructure-as-Code pipelines are indispensable for standardisation at scale. The shift in administrator responsibilities stood out: rather than reducing demand, AI expands the skill set required, emphasising governance, AIOps, and cross-team collaboration (NIST, 2018).</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Application:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">In my current role, AI-based cost optimisation tools like AWS Compute Optimizer could directly reduce cloud expenditure, while self-healing Kubernetes clusters would strengthen service continuity. Continuous compliance monitoring would support regulatory obligations such as FCA and GDPR. By combining scripting for automation with GUI tools for ad-hoc use, our team can balance efficiency with accessibility for less technical colleagues.</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Forward Planning:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">I plan to develop stronger scripting expertise in Python and Terraform to extend automation and integrate CI/CD pipelines. I also aim to experiment with AIOps platforms that embed AI into observability and compliance monitoring, ensuring greater resilience and governance in multi-cloud deployments. Building these skills will prepare me for hybrid roles that combine technical architecture, automation, and AI-driven governance.</p>

        </p>

        <h4 class="activity">Summary:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">This week focused on cloud security and compliance, particularly how cloud controls map to frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, and GDPR. The lecturecast explored cloud-native technologies and containerisation, while the coursework involved performing a security audit of an OpenStack deployment using OpenVAS. This highlighted risks such as unpatched services and weak authentication, and how they align with industry standards (ISO, 2022; NIST, 2020; PCI SSC, 2022; European Union, 2016).</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Reflection:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">The OpenVAS audit made me reflect on how technical vulnerabilities directly connect to compliance obligations. ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.12.6 emphasises vulnerability management, while GDPR Article 32 highlights secure data processing (ISO, 2022; European Union, 2016). NIST SP 800-53 controls such as SI-2 (Flaw Remediation) and AC-2 (Account Management) provided guidance on structured remediation (NIST, 2020). PCI DSS reinforced the need for continuous patching and monitoring to protect cardholder data (PCI SSC, 2022). Overall, the activity showed that audits must not stop at technical fixes, but be interpreted within governance and regulatory frameworks.</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Application:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">In FinTech, where sensitive financial data is at stake, these insights are highly relevant. Regulators expect evidence that vulnerabilities are addressed and compliance demonstrated. Linking cloud controls to ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, and GDPR provides assurance of due diligence. Similarly, the disaster recovery design exercise reinforced how RPO and RTO targets map to ISO 22301, ensuring both resilience and compliance (ISO, 2019). This mapping directly informs operational practices in my role, where audits, compliance reviews, and regulator expectations converge.</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Forward Planning:</h4>
        <p class="reflection">I plan to deepen my knowledge of cloud compliance by experimenting with automated compliance monitoring tools, such as AWS Config and Azure Policy, to map controls continuously against ISO 27001 and GDPR. Developing stronger skills in OpenVAS and other vulnerability management tools will allow me to connect technical findings with compliance requirements more effectively. This will prepare me for governance-driven roles where bridging technical risk and regulatory obligations is critical.</p>

        <h4 class="activity">Reflective Thinking:</h4>
        <p class="reflection"><h4 class="activity">Summary:</h4>
<p class="reflection">This week focused on disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity, highlighting how cloud-based strategies can achieve resilience objectives. The readings (Carson and Rodrick, 2024; Zheng et al., 2024) emphasised the need to define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), then design DR solutions that balance cost, performance, and compliance. The coursework activity reinforced this by simulating recovery on OpenStack using open-source tools such as Bacula or Duplicity.</p>

<h4 class="activity">Reflection:</h4>
<p class="reflection">I reflected on how DR is not only a technical requirement but also a governance obligation. ISO 22301 provides a framework for business continuity management, while ISO/IEC 27001 and GDPR require demonstrable resilience and data protection (ISO, 2019; ISO, 2022; European Union, 2016). In practice, I recognised that achieving a low RTO/RPO involves trade-offs: tighter objectives improve resilience but increase cost and complexity. The OpenStack exercise showed how open-source tools can provide flexibility, but they also demand strong operational discipline to avoid misconfiguration risks.</p>

<h4 class="activity">Application:</h4>
<p class="reflection">In the FinTech sector, regulators such as the FCA require firms to demonstrate robust DR and continuity strategies. For example, ensuring payment processing systems can recover within 1 hour (RTO) and limiting data loss to minutes (RPO) is vital to customer trust and compliance. Using multi-cloud patterns, such as active-active replication between AWS and Azure, could enhance resilience while mitigating vendor lock-in. The activity also showed that DR must integrate with broader compliance frameworks, linking directly to audits and governance reporting.</p>

<h4 class="activity">Forward Planning:</h4>
<p class="reflection">I plan to expand my knowledge of DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service) providers such as Zerto and Veeam, while also exploring how policy-as-code can embed RTO/RPO objectives into infrastructure-as-code pipelines. This will prepare me to design DR strategies that are not only technically effective but also compliant, auditable, and aligned with ISO 22301 standards.</p>

</p>

<h4 class="activity">Reflection:</h4>
<p class="reflection">
 <h4 class="activity">Summary:</h4>
<p class="reflection">This week focused on hybrid cloud solutions and practical migration exercises. The lecturecast on Hybrid Cloud highlighted design patterns where OpenStack integrates with public clouds for elasticity and compliance (Maurer, 2021). The formative coursework involved migrating a MySQL database to OpenStack using Percona XtraBackup. Attempting this on Windows exposed constraints with tooling support, requiring workarounds such as staging backups through Linux-based environments to achieve minimal downtime. The readings further explored cloud security through deep learning (Zhou et al., 2023) and the strategic trade-offs between cloud-agnostic and vendor-locked DevOps approaches (Dunbar, 2024).</p>

<h4 class="activity">Reflection:</h4>
<p class="reflection">I reflected on how hybrid cloud design requires balancing control and flexibility. Maurer (2021) emphasised governance and workload placement, while the migration exercise reinforced that technical constraints—like limited Windows support for Percona tools—can shape architecture choices. The workaround demonstrated resilience but also highlighted risks of misconfiguration. The article on machine learning in cloud security showed how predictive models can strengthen proactive defence, while the vendor lock-in piece illustrated that even cloud-agnostic aspirations come with trade-offs, often requiring more expertise and cost (Dunbar, 2024). This reminded me that migrations and hybrid strategies must align with both compliance and operational realities.</p>

<h4 class="activity">Application:</h4>
<p class="reflection">In financial services, migrating core databases demands both data consistency and near-zero downtime. Using tools like Percona XtraBackup is relevant, but production environments would require clustering, replication, and automated failover. Hybrid solutions also provide opportunities to isolate sensitive workloads on OpenStack while leveraging cloud elasticity for analytics. AI-driven monitoring, as described by Zhou et al. (2023), could further secure these deployments. At the same time, vendor-locked tooling such as Azure DevOps may accelerate pipelines but needs conscious governance to prevent strategic dependency.</p>

<h4 class="activity">Forward Planning:</h4>
<p class="reflection">I plan to test database migrations using Linux-native environments to minimise workarounds and experiment with hybrid models that blend OpenStack with AWS or Azure. I also intend to explore AIOps platforms for predictive security and evaluate cloud-agnostic orchestration tools like Kubernetes against vendor-locked CI/CD to balance flexibility and integration. Building these skills will prepare me for architecting resilient, compliant, and strategically balanced hybrid environments.</p>
