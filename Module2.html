                                    <p>An excellent discussion of risks and justifications for the use of analytical tools - including attack trees (one of the first students to try!)</p>
                                    <p>It featured a detailed explanation of the calculations and data sources used.</p>
                                    <p>A good range of applicable and relatively up-to-date references were used.</p>
                                    <p>A very good discussion of the risks and potential mitigations available to mitigate them.</p>
                                    <p>There were good examples of critical analysis in the data analysis and reports provided.</p>
                                    <p>A good set of diagrams and in-depth discussions of the solution - albeit a little light on the discussion of lock-ins.</p>
                                    <p>A good attempt at a critical review of the services offered.</p>
                                    <p>A very well-structured and presented report covering both sections.</p>
                                    <p>A good set of citations - however, there were a few errors in the references (available at rather than available from) and some references were a little old.</p>
                                    <p>An excellent report - with an obviously significant amount of work invested - and the use of AD trees as well!</p>
