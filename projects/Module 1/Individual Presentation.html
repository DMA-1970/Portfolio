            <h1>Individual Presentation Instructions</h1>
            <p><strong>Your Individual Presentation must be submitted by the end of Unit 12.</strong></p>

            <p>This presentation is equivalent to 2,000 words. The equivalence stated refers to the amount of effort required to complete the given word count. You are expected to spend the same amount of time on this assessment as you would doing a 2,000-word essay.</p>

            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>You are tasked with developing a PowerPoint presentation (of up to 10 slides) that reflects on future technology/techniques and learning styles. In addition to your PowerPoint, you should also create a recording of your individual reflection (20 minutes in length) with a transcript.</p>

            <p>Please submit all 3 aspects (the PowerPoint, recording, and transcript) to the submission portal below.</p>

            <h2>Question</h2>
            <p>Consider the statement: <em>“Enterprise IT encapsulates ALL the technology trends that will make the greatest impact on Industry in the next five years”.</em></p>

            <p>Identify ONE trend that you feel will have the greatest impact over the next five years.</p>

            <p>In describing your chosen trend, you should also explain why you think it will have the most impact and how you think it will impact industry and working life. Your slides should have a strong reflective bias focus with critical insights, considering the effects as opposed to the technical aspects of your chosen trend.</p>

            <h2>For the reflective aspect, consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How did working on the assessments make you feel? </li>
                <li>How did these emotions affect you and your everyday work? </li>
                <li>Have you reviewed the views of others, your prior experience, and correctly referenced literature, in relation to your current behaviour and the work you’ve done?</li>
                <li>Show that you have thought deeply about what exactly produced your learning (or a new way of thinking) while taking this module.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, you are required to record a 20-minute presentation, along with a transcript of the audio file. The presentation should include your demonstration. Your slides should not be wordy or repeat, verbatim, the oral presentation. Visuals, illustrations, statistics, charts, tables, and indications of key pointers are welcome. In assessing the presentation for marking, emphasis will be placed on the oral content. However, clarity of the visual presentation will also be taken into account.</p>

            <p>It is strongly recommended that, in order to record your presentation, you use a headset with a microphone.</p>

            <p>Note that an average speech rate for a comfortable and clearly orally paced presentation is about 100-150 words per minute.</p>

            <h2>Important Note</h2>
            <p>Appendices should not be used to extend the core report, as reports should stand alone, complete, and concise, without the appendices. They should only be used if required and only for supplementary and/or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely, and with necessary brevity.</p>

            <p>Please ensure that your citations and list of references are included in the slides and citations mentioned in your transcript.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Critical evaluation of the literature and current developments and challenges in the field of IT service management (QMC).</li>
                <li>Systematically identify and manage scientific and technical risk and uncertainty associated with IT service management and its applications.</li>
            </ul>
