            <h1>QRM Activity</h1>
            <p>Please carry out this activity before joining the seminar this week. Your answers will be discussed during the seminar.</p>
            
            <h2>Activity</h2>

            <h3>Part A</h3>
            <p>Read Goerlandt et al (2017), Hugo et al (2018) and Çelikbilek & Tüysüz (2020) and answer the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do Goerlandt et al (2017) suggest that the validity of QRA approaches can be validated? What did they posit was the most effective approach?</li>
                <li>Which techniques did Hugo et al (2018) suggest should be applied to project management? What were their recommendations to increase the use of QR analysis in Projects?</li>
                <li>The last paper reviews various Multi-Criteria Decision Methods (MCDMs) and considered the relative accuracy and validity of the techniques. Which did they find was the most accurate of the methods compared? What were the failings of the general TOPSIS approach?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="projects/Quantitative Risk Modelling.pdf" target="_blank">Go to Part A</a></p>

            <h3>Part B</h3>
            <p>Read chapter 5 of the course text (Olsen & Desheng, 2020) and implement the inventory Monte Carlo simulation. You can use Yasai (Eckstein & Riedmuller, 2002) to replace Crystal Ball. If you have difficulty implementing the course text model, there is a simplified model also available. Their paper gives instructions on its use. Be prepared to discuss your results in the seminar.</p>

            <p>You should add your answers to your e-portfolio and be prepared to discuss them as part of this week's seminar.</p>
