            <h1>ESIR - Enterprise Systems Implementation Report</h1>

            <p>Submit by end of unit 11.</p>

            <p>Word count 2,000 words. This assignment carries 40% of the overall module grade.</p>

            <p>This summative assessment builds on the summative assessment completed in unit 6.</p>

            <h4 class="activity">Assignment Topic and Guidance</h4>
            <p>This assignment follows on from your work in the unit 9 submission, where you designed a strategy for EDA using the statistics of the traffic in the London region. Ensure you review the feedback you received from that submission before attempting this assignment.</p>

            <p>Your assignment should contain the following aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A brief description of traffic in the London region (5% weighting).</li>
                <li>A detailed description of a typical EDA Model placing emphasis on Storage (15% weighting).</li>
                <li>The step-by-step data analysis methods undertaken. If there is any deviation from the original design, please provide a rationale for change (10% weighting).</li>
                <li>Sequential presentation of the data analysis results in the form of models (35% weighting).</li>
                <li>Provide your own interpretation of the result for each Data Model. From this interpretation the issues related to the London Traffic Statistics in the identified region (25% weighting).</li>
                <li>Provide solution(s) to overcome the identified issues with possible limitation/risks involved (10% weighting).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="activity">Assignment Submission</h4>
            <p>An implementation of an EDA model capturing data management and deployment concepts of Clouds, Datawarehouse, and Lakes and a Rationale document explaining the content above (1000 words).</p>

            <h4 class="activity">Learning Outcomes</h4>
            <p>Understand the application and management of enterprise-based systems through digitalisation.</p>
            <p>Optimise the use of limited resources to enable Businesses stay competitive and efficient.</p>
            <p>Apply and evaluate critically the various data management methods, tools, technologies, and success factors applied to a data science programme to develop an effective plan and delivery of solutions to a variety of business scenarios.</p>

            <h4 class="activity">Turnitin Originality Check</h4>
            <p>Before submitting your assignment, it is important to check the originality of your work by submitting your assignment to Turnitin.</p>

            <p>By submitting your assignment to this tool you will receive an originality report which can be used to check that you have not included other authors work without correct citation. It is important to note that submitting your work to the Turnitin Originality Check tool does not count as a submission of your final work. You must still submit your assignment below.</p>

            <h4 class="activity">Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</h4>
            <p>We take academic integrity very seriously. Academic integrity means acting with fairness and honesty, giving credit to others where you are referring to their ideas or research and respecting the work of others. Plagiarism is defined as: 'Using or copying the work of others (whether written, printed or in any other form) without proper acknowledgement'. Before you finalise your assignment take time to check that all your statements are backed up with supporting evidence, that all sources you use - whether referring to their ideas, quoting directly or paraphrasing - are correctly referenced in the text. Correct use of referencing acknowledges the academic whose work has informed yours, enables the reader to find the sources you have used and demonstrates your ability to find and analyse relevant information.</p>

            <p>Failure to properly acknowledge the work of others is an academic offence and may result in your work incurring a penalty or, in the most serious cases, you being removed from the course for academic dishonesty.</p>

            <p>If you are unsure about referencing or plagiarism there are useful resources available in the Study Skills Hub which is accessible from the menu on the left hand side. If you are still experiencing difficulties with academic integrity then you can contact the Study Skills Team for individualised support.</p>

            <p>Please note, a word count penalty applies to this assessment.</p>

            <p>If your assessment exceeds the word count limit or range by more than 10% then your awarded grade will be reduced by 10% grade points. For more information please see your student handbook.</p>

            <p>Not meeting the word count</p>

            <p>There is no grade reduction applied if your assignment does not meet the word count range or limit, but to maximise your opportunity to achieve the highest grade possible, you should aim to meet the word count or range as closely as possible.</p>
